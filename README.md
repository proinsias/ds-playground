# Data Science Playground

My playground for data science code.

## Setup Guide

```shell
pre-commit install --install-hooks
./scripts/install-kernel - no? save somewhere else.
uv run --with jupyterlab jupyter lab  # Need --with jupyterlab for jupytext to work and to get editable project dependency.

# Don't use devbox uv! Use homebrew instead.
```
